| [Nest Protect v2 Battery](https://amzn.to/2LJ0ACn)           |    3     | Wi-Fi      | [Nest](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/nest/) | Dual Smoke and CO Alarm.  One of the best fire/carbon monoxide alarms.  But recently Google has removed API access, and so the integration with Home Assistant is no longer working. |
| [Aqara Vibration Sensor](https://www.aqara.com/us/vibration_sensor.html) |    2     | Zigbee     | Binary Sensor                                          | I purchased it to automate (getting end of the cycle notificatoins) from my washing machine and dryer.  Not reliably automated yet. |

I wrote a script to blink Philips Hue bulbs when there is an alarm from Nest Protect.  Now that the Nest integration is broken, this has become useless.
